## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned a lot about Flexbox properties and how to use them effectively to center elements on the page. For example, in my body styling, I used properties like `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, and `justify-content: center` to properly center the main container both vertically and horizontally:


```css
body{
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    font-size: 15px;
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    min-height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;    
}
```

### Continued development

Next time, I’d like to explore CSS Grid more deeply and see how I can incorporate it into my layout structure for even cleaner and more flexible designs.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox Layout Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox properties. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
